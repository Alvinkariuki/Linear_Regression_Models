IMPORTANT !!!

Kindly note that from the various implementations of gradient descent, the theta
values tend to remain the same

Concretely, possibly for this dataset, the gradient descent algorithm used does
not matter, and the variation in
theta values are too miniscule to make much of an impact in predicting the continuous
prose of new input examples


Ideally the results from an off-shelf advanced optimization gradient descent algorithm
yield the following results
      ~The advanced optimization will be provided by SCipy  which is a python library that allows for
      optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing,
      ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering
